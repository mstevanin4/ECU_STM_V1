These 8 function turn a schedule on, provides the time to start and the duration and gives it callback functions.

Args:
startCallback: The function to be called once the timeout is reached
timeout: The number of uS in the future that the startCallback should be triggered
duration: The number of uS after startCallback is called before endCallback is called
endCallback: This function is called once the duration time has been reached
